# Augmented Futures — quick start

1. Put your images into the `images/` folder and rename them to match these filenames (or update `index.html`):
   - immersive.jpg
   - augmented-body.jpg
   - biofeedback.jpg
   - post-human.jpg

2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double‑click) or use VS Code Live Server.
3. Edit text in the HTML and styles in `style.css`. The layout is responsive.

Tip: If your image names differ, just change the `src` attributes in the `<img>` tags.
